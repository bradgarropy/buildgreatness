*Halfway through the cut, I'm seeing steady weight loss, lower body fat, and minimal effect on my strength.* So far the cut has gone according to plan, but I know these last two months will become more difficult as calories dwindle.

### Progress So Far

The chart below shows my expected weight loss versus the actual results I've achieved. So far everything has been going to plan, as I've been able to lose around 1.5 pounds each week.

My body composition has changed for the better during this weight loss. Although some of my measurements have gone down slightly like bicep, chest and shoulders, I've seen the largest change in my waist line. You can check the [Year Long Bulk Results]({% post_url 2016-03-01-year-long-bulk-results %}) for my starting measurements.

| Weight  | Shoulders | Chest    | Bicep | Waist |
|:-------:|:---------:|:--------:|:-----:|:-----:|
| 183lbs  | 49.5 in   | 42.25 in | 15 in | 35 in |

As for my strength, I am hoping the switch to the [PHAT training program]({% post_url 2016-04-11-phat-new-training-program %}) will help me keep the majority of muscle mass and strength I had gained. So far I have only experienced a slight drop in reps on some exercises, mostly overhead pressing movements. You can always view my full workout routine on the [Training](/training) page.

Everyone is different when it comes to how and where they lose fat throughout a cut. For me, it has happened in this order.

* Arms
* Back
* Chest
* Stomach

The above pictures show my current physique from the front and back. These were taken mid-day, after eating some meals, with no special lighting or preparation. In the next two months, I'm hoping to see the majority of fat loss occur on my stomach, further exposing my abs.

### Diet & Cardio Adjustments

When I began the cut, I was eating roughly 4000 calories per day. I've been slowly reducing the number of carbohydrates each week which puts me at 2685 calories per day. You can see a full breakdown of my diet on the [Macros](/macros) page.

| Protein  | Carbs    | Fat     | Total    |
|:--------:|:--------:|:-------:|:--------:|
| 275g     | 250g     | 65g     | N/A      |
| 41%      | 37%      | 22%     | 100%     |
| 1100cals | 1000cals | 585cals | 2685cals |
{: class="table table-bordered table-condensed" }

In order to reduce hunger, I've been adding volume to my meals by replacing high caloric density foods with low caloric density foods. For example, I've removed sweet potatoes, which contain lots of calories, and added lettuce and spinach, which have almost no calories whatsoever. This allows me to feel more full, while still fitting my macros.

I have not yet incorporated any additional cardio for the cut. My plan is to begin slowly adding cardio in the last two months as my calories hit the lowest point. I'll primarily focus on LISS (low intensity steady state) cardio, like incline treadmill walking, with HIIT (high intensity interval training) only if LISS isn't working well enough.

### Finish It!

As the cut nears the end, I'll have to be more strict with diet and cardio to achieve the sub 10% body fat level I desire. You can follow along by checking the [Macros](/macros) and [Training](/training) pages for exact details on my regiment. Check back in July for the complete review of the cut!

Wish me luck!
