*I once went to a Casey Donahew show where a fight broke out during the first song.* That's the kind of music the [Casey Donahew Band](http://www.caseydonahewband.com/) plays, songs that channel your inner cowboy and get you fired up for a rowdy night. The [Pre-Party EP](https://open.spotify.com/album/3Z2qQgwRMKDXr6lHunq4cL) is just a taste of what will be included on the upcoming *All Night Party* album, and it's damn good.

### Country Song

Country Song starts the album off on an even keel, not too rocky, and not too slow. Casey sings about the usual country stuff: trucks, alcohol, and girls. I see this song striking a chord with everyone. It would be a great opener for his shows, encouraging a lot of crowd participation with the "crowd that just can't stop singing along."

### Feels This Right

The second song on the EP has more of an edge, apparent from the very first guitar riff. The heavy downbeats in the intro and bridge really reminds me of Josh Abbott Band's [Hangin' Around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbHVNPZsJ4). It's another great singalong song which gets broken up by a jarring triplet transition to end the bridge, my favorite part of the track!

### That's Why We Ride

During his shows, Casey thanks his fans for listening to his "cowboy music". While the melody and rhythm guitar sound too much like pop country, the lyrics are exactly what a cowboy wants to hear. I'm happy to hear a song about the rodeo from Casey, as he and his bass player are team roping partners.

### White Trash Bay

As soon as I read the title I got excited that this track was going to continue the White Trash storyline from the [Double-Wide Dream](https://open.spotify.com/album/3bBRPDBYd3RycEIxo9y5i0) album. Unfortunately, that was not the case, but these rowdy tall tale songs showcase Casey's creativity. You can only image what kind of crazy the bartender Scarlett must be to have that tramp stamp, or what he'd have to do to end up in the river with concrete boots.

Give the [Pre-Party](https://open.spotify.com/album/3Z2qQgwRMKDXr6lHunq4cL) album a listen for yourself and let me know what you think. Be sure to catch Casey Donahew at [Lonestar Jam](http://www.lonestarjam.com/) on May 7th!
