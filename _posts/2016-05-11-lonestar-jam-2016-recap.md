*Lonestar Jam, our favorite weekend of the year, has come and gone much like our hangovers.* We got to experience great music, terrible weather, and good times all around. Here's what I thought of this year's [Lonestar Jam](http://lonestarjam.com/).

### Venue

The change of venue was probably the biggest shock to me. In my opinion the LBJ lawn was the perfect festival grounds. Although I'm not sure why the folks at [415 Productions](http://www.415e.com/) changed locations, they did the best with what they had. But what they had was a flat, barren field.

The addition of the 4,000 square foot beer tent was a great idea. Without it, attendance would have dropped dramatically. The tent helped to keep people dry during the downpour, and shaded when the sun was out. The tent sold all of the usual can beers, and even had some premium beers on tap this year.

One of the toughest times of the weekend was early on during Day 2. Rain was in the forecast and it set in quickly while Zane Williams was on stage. The crowd in front of the stage thinned out and moved under the tent. Being fully committed to the Lonestar Jam experience, we decided to stay out in the rain, that is until we were completely soaked through, jeans, boots, and all.

We realized our phones were at risk of getting completely ruined. We were aware of LSJ's no re-entry policy, but hoped under the special circumstances (torrential downpour) that the staff would let us drop off our phones at our truck. They wouldn't budge, not even an inch. If LSJ is going to be a rain or shine event, I believe that 415 Productions should have been a bit more flexible on policies when the worst weather hits. Other less dedicated attendees would have left the festival if they had no way to protect their electronics. Lucky for us, we had a friend working the beer tent who lent us a hand.

The food trucks were lined up along the right side of the main entrance. Food choices were expanded this year, as there were about eight different vendors. Freebirds is always our go to, as a burrito is healthy, filling, and worth the cost. We also had to get the mandatory corn dog. One of the new food trucks stood out to me in particular, [Ground Up](http://www.grounduptruck.com/). They offered great healthy choices, like grilled steak and hummus, for good prices.

The artist merchandise booths were set up opposite the food trucks, lining the left side of the main entrance. I was surprised each day by how few booths there were, only two or three from the artists. The majority of the booths were from sponsors or affiliated country vendors.

### Music

In my opinion this year's line up was the best it's been! Bands that don't come around often like The Cadillac Three and Mike Ryan had me excited, and staples like Randy Rogers, Kevin Fowler, and Charlie Robison kept that classic Lonestar Jam feel.

It's always good to see our friends on stage with **Jon Wolfe** and heckle them from the crowd. Jon had a great performance and his [Natural Man](https://open.spotify.com/album/1AoQKQp75VpX5Gaz55BYo1) album has picked up speed since it released.

**William Clark Green** has become a hell of a performer, and was the highlight of Day 1 for me. Let's just say I was having *lots* of fun during his show.

I'm a huge **Casey Donahew** fan, and it was great to hear his [Pre-Party]({% post_url 2016-04-16-review-casey-donahews-pre-party %}) songs played live. They definitely struck a chord with the crowd and sounded great on stage.

**Zane Williams** has some of the best fans, many stayed out in the pouring rain to hear his set. His Music Mondays encourage fan interaction, and his live shows provide some unforgettable moments, like when he sang completely unplugged during a power outage at MusicFest 2016. This year at Lonestar Jam was no exception, as he jumped off stage and let a fan sing a portion of 99 Bottles. Here's to you Zane!

I've never seen **Mike Ryan** live, and I was really looking forward to this show. Unfortunately, he wasn't as impactful as I thought he would be.

**Kyle Park** got the crowd going with Turn That Crown Upside Down, but besides that I felt as though he lost the crowd's interest this year.

**The Cadillac Three** don't come around often, but when they do, Jaron puts his heart and soul into their show and their drummer just can't sit down!

**Cody Johnson** used Lonestar Jam as an opportunity to preview some new songs from his upcoming album Gotta Be Me. I said "just think, in a few months we'll all be yelling these lyrics." I was happy to hear new stuff from Cody, I just wish I was familiar with the songs!

### Wrapping Up

Lonestar Jam 2016 delivered as always! Next year I hope to see the same great line up, but in a better location and with better weather. 415 Productions, I'm looking forward to 2017, contact me if you're looking for a new face with a fresh opinion!
