*Two years ago I was tiny.* I weighed a buck forty and could run six miles like it was nothing. In fact, I ran every day. But the endurance came with the drawback of having no strength or muscle mass whatsoever. So I set out to change that.

### Getting Started in the Gym

My apartment complex at the time had a really nice gym, so I found a workout routine and started lifting five days a week. Strength was increasing and I saw my weight going up, but my [diet was ridiculous](https://www.instagram.com/p/ZOTYtMKYnW/). The only real strategy I had was to "[eat clean](https://www.instagram.com/p/a9pyg4qYtr/)". I remember having toast for breakfast, a turkey sandwich with veggies for lunch, and chicken with broccoli for dinner. Granted, this was more than I usually ate, but I didn't want to become "too bro" and start stressing over diet, meal prepping, or counting macros.

Over the course of about a year I put on roughly 25 pounds and was weighing a comfortable 165. I moved into a new apartment with my new wife in December 2015, and started looking for a new gym once the new year hit.

### Metroflex Motivation

*Metroflex changed everything*. From the second I walked in, I knew that gym was where I needed to be to continue developing my physique. [Metroflex Austin](https://www.facebook.com/MetroflexAustin/) has some of the top powerlifters, bikini, and physique competitors in the country who train there every day. My goals were placed right in front of me, all I had to do was put in the work and consistency.

As I still didn't have enough muscle mass on me, I decided that a bulk would be the best strategy. It was already January by that point, so I knew that if I wanted to start the yearly bulk/cut cadence, I wouldn't have enough time to do a complete bulk before summer hit. So instead, I made the bold decision to bulk for a full year to add as much mass as possible.

### Bulking Macros

Throughout the bulk my macros changed slightly, but the following macros were what I was eating when the bulk was done. I set the protein high, and aimed for 1.5g per pound of body weight. I kept fat fairly low, less than 20%. I did that because I noticed that my skin was not as clear when eating high amounts of fat. Carbs filled rounded out the rest of the macros, and as you can see, my carbs were very high.

| Protein  | Carbs    | Fat     | Total    |
|:--------:|:--------:|:-------:|:--------:|
| 275g     | 645g     | 65g     | N/A      |
| 26%      | 60%      | 14%     | 100%     |
| 1100cals | 2580cals | 585cals | 4265cals |

I am definitely a "hard-gainer" who needs quite a bit of extra calories to move the scale up. If I ever missed my calories for the day, my weight would drop. In order to ensure weight gain and sanity, I ate one to two cheat meals a week. I at a large pizza religiously every Sunday night. I *highly* recommend pepperoni and onions!

Throughout the bulk I tracked my weight every morning via [MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/profile/bradgarropy). My goal was to gain 0.5 pounds per week, any more would be adding excess fat. I also tracked my measurements every six weeks, including bicep, chest, waist, and shoulders.

### Meal Breakdown

Sundays are meal prep days. I cook food for the entire week and place it in tupperware to store in the fridge. My goal was to eat unprocessed foods and stay as lean as possible given that the bulk was going to last so long. Therefore, the diet was very simple. The meals are listed below.

* __Breakfast__
  * 5 Whole Eggs
  * 3 Oatmeals

* __AM Shake__
  * 1 Scoop [Protein](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/opt/whey.html)

* __Lunch 1__
  * 150g Ground Beef
  * 150g Brown Rice
  * 150g Sweet Potatoes

* __Lunch 2__
  * 150g Ground Beef
  * 150g Brown Rice
  * 150g Sweet Potatoes

* __Pre-Workout Shake__
  * 1 Scoop [Karbolyn](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/aap/karbolyn.html)
  * 2 Scoops [C4](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/cellucor/c4.html)

* __Post-Workout Shake__
  * 1 Scoop [Karbolyn](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/aap/karbolyn.html)
  * 1 Scoop [Creatine](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/opt/crea.html)
  * 2 Scoops [Protein](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/opt/whey.html)

* __Dinner__
  * 150g Ground Chicken
  * 150g Brown Rice
  * 150g Sweet Potatoes

* __PM Shake__
  * 1 Scoop [Casein](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/opt/cas.html)

### Final Results

I gained *35 pounds* over the course of a year. That roughly equates to 0.67 pounds per week, which was a bit more aggressive than my goal of 0.5 pounds per week. You can see the full graph below.

I put on more than just weight though, my strength and size increased drastically. I hit a PR of 225lbs on the bench press, which had always been a dream of mine. Here are my measurements from when the bulk ended.

| Weight  | Shoulders | Chest | Bicep | Waist |
|:-------:|:---------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| 200lbs  | 51.5 in   | 43 in | 16 in | 37 in |

### Future Plans

The bulk officially ended March 1, 2016. The plan is to cut for about four months, until July 1st, and reach a weight of around 170lbs. Based on how much mass I've gained, this should put me at a very low, less than 10%, body fat level. Time to get shredded for the summer!
