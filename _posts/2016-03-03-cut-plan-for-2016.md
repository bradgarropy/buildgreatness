*Losing fat was never a concern for me.* But now that I've just come off a [one year bulk]({% post_url 2016-03-01-year-long-bulk-results %}), I'm holding quite a bit of fat on top of all that newly gained muscle. Not to mention, summer time is coming up, and if I'm not jacked and tan, I'll look like I don't even lift!

###  Goals & Strategy

This cut has two main goals.

* Lose fat
* Slow down my metabolism

Though the first goal is the most common, it is important to consider the second. While bulking, your metabolism gets much faster in order to adjust to the larger amounts of food you are eating. Eating in a deficit during a cut will help to slow down the metabolism and thus, allow you to begin your next bulk from a lower calorie count.

The overall strategy is to lose 1.5 pounds per week for four months from March 1st to July 1st. This plan should bring me from 200 pounds down to 170 pounds, hopefully putting me under 10% body fat. I made a graph showing the expected progress week over week.

### Macros & Adjustments

I will begin the cut by dropping 100g of [Karbolyn](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/aap/karbolyn.html), a carbohydrate supplement I use during and after workouts, from my diet. This will put my total calories at 3865 and should start the weight loss. My macro breakdown is shown below.

| Protein  | Carbs    | Fat     | Total    |
|:--------:|:--------:|:-------:|:--------:|
| 275g     | 545g     | 65g     | N/A      |
| 28%      | 56%      | 15%     | 100%     |
| 1100cals | 2180cals | 585cals | 3865cals |

Every week I'll average my weight, and compare to the previous week's average. If I am not losing roughly 1.5 pounds per week, I will lower my intake by 100 calories. These small drops in calories ensure that I will not lose too much weight too fast, which could cause muscle loss. Because it is important to keep protein intake high during a cut, I'll only be decreasing carbohydrates when lowering my calories.

As for cardio, I will continue my regular routine: 10 minutes of incline treadmill after every workout. Cardio will only be added if I feel as though the amount of food I'm eating isn't enough to keep my energy levels high. I anticipate this may come into play in the last month or so of the cut.

### Progress Updates

I will be tracking weight as usual in [MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/profile/bradgarropy), in addition to the graph shown above. You can follow along on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bradgarropy/) as well for gym and progress pictures. Check back in at the beginning of May, when I'll post another article detailing my progress halfway through the cut!
