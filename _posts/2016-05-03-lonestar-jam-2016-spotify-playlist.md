*Look no further for the best Lonestar Jam playlist on Spotify.* I noticed a few [Lonestar Jam](http://lonestarjam.com/) playlists going up this week on [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/), and realized that most of them were not to my liking. Some had too many songs, some had too few, and others focused on the wrong artists in my opinion.

So I went ahead and made my own [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/bradgarropy/playlist/0OV99Ep2d1DCENJRPuEtXV), nothing but the best of Texas country artists coming to play at Lonestar Jam in Austin, Texas this weekend.
