This piece of graffiti lies on an abandoned power plant on Lady Bird Lake in Austin, Texas. A Google search revealed that Bernd and Renik are German boys names, possibly the artists? There's a [Flickr account](https://www.flickr.com/photos/quiet-silence/) with lots of graffiti that mentions the names.
