*Mentally and physically this cut was the hardest thing I've ever volunteered to put myself through, but the challenge and dedication was worth it.* Most of the time, the biggest hurdles were mental. I had to tell myself that feeling hungry was just because I was forcing my body to change, and that the goal was more important than temporarily feeling uncomfortable. After the [year long bulk]({% post_url 2016-03-01-year-long-bulk-results %}), four months of body recomposition was what I needed to show off the results I worked so hard for.

### Weight Loss Perfection

The goal was to lose a steady 1.5 pounds per week over the course of four months to end up just below 170 pounds. Weight loss went extremely well for me, and I was incredibly consistent. I used a Python program I developed called the [Macrolyzer](https://github.com/bradgarropy/macrolyzer) to track weekly average weight and ensure I was hitting my goals.

As you can see from the graph above, my actual weight loss matched almost identical to what I had planned. Over the course of the four months, I averaged **1.84 pounds per week**, which is actually a little more than I planned on. I went from 200 pounds down to 167.6 pounds.

### The Hanger was Real

I used the same diet strategy for the cut as I did the bulk. If the average weekly weight loss wasn't showing 1.5 pounds, I adjusted the macros down by 100 calories to start weight loss again. Each time I reduced calories, I reduced either carbs or fats, and kept the protein at a consistent 1.5 grams per pound of body weight.

The diet didn't get difficult until the last four weeks when my carbs started dropping below 100 grams per day. I felt tired, weak, thirsty, and irritable. These symptoms occur because with such low carbohydrate levels, the body's glycogen stores run dry, which is the main form of energy storage. In order to combat this, I had a refeed once per week where I ate an extra 85 grams of carbs that day to refill my glycogen stores and feel more energized for the next few days.

| Protein | Carbs   | Fat     | Total    |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:--------:|
| 245g    | 25g     | 50g     | N/A      |
| 64%     | 7%      | 29%     | 100%     |
| 980cals | 100cals | 450cals | 1530cals |

Above are my macros for the final week of the cut. You can see that these are very very low, especially when it comes to carbs. This would be *impossible* to maintain for any period of time longer than a week without beginning to lose a lot of muscle.

### Strength & Size Changes

When reducing calories to lose weight, the risk of losing strength is a real problem. I did my best to minimize strength loss by changing my programming to include both powerlifting and bodybuilding workouts by using the [PHAT training program]({% post_url 2016-04-11-phat-new-training-program %}). The powerlifting portion of the program forced me to keep my strength high as my weight dropped.

Ultimately, I only noticed strength loss in the last four weeks of the cut, when my carbohydrates were very low. My bench and squat each lost about 20 pounds by the end of the cut. However, I believe the strength will come back very quickly, as I think the bad performance was just due to low energy and fatigue.

As for size, I lost a few inches everywhere, but I'm happy to see that the biggest change came in my waistline. From what I've read, the more bulk/cut cycles you do, the more fat is stored around muscles rather than the waist line. Hopefully this means abs can stay more prominent during the next bulk.

### Physique Changes

I am very happy with the way the cut turned out. I accomplished my goal of 170 pounds, and ended up looking pretty lean. The plan is to continue these bulk/cut cycles, and hopefully gain more size while staying more lean every year. So with that, here's the result of four months of pure dedication.

### What's Next?
First and foremost, binge! But after that, it's time for another bulk. The goal for this bulk will be to gain size while staying as lean as possible. I will be increasing macros very conservatively over the course of the next nine months until April 2017.

I also want to stop being "weak" for my size. During this bulk I want to increase strength on the main three lifts to the following numbers:

* Bench - 225
* Squat - 315
* Dead - 405

If you're gym savvy you'll notice that this is two, three, and four plates. Adding this up puts me at a 945 pound total, so a stretch goal of mine is to reach the **1000 pound club**.
