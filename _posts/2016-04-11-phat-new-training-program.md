*Consistency makes me a good bodybuilder. Consistency also makes me a bad bodybuilder.* You see, I've never had a problem working out daily, or sticking to my diet. I'm the definition of consistent. In fact, I'm so consistent, I stuck to the same workout routine for a whole year while I was [bulking]({% post_url 2016-03-01-year-long-bulk-results %}). This type of consistency is bad, because my body had adapted to the usual routine of each workout. Now that my [cut]({% post_url 2016-03-03-cut-plan-for-2016 %}) is starting, it's time to shock my body with a new style of training.

### Strength & Physique Goals
In order to fully explain why I've chosen this new training routine, I need to clarify my strength and physique goals. I have started a cut, which means that I want to lose body fat, become leaner, and improve my physique. This goal requires hypertrophy work, higher reps per set to pump blood into my muscles in the traditional bodybuilding style.

However, I also want to start gaining more strength. My big three lifts (bench, squat, and deadlift) are way below where they should be. Even my buddy Josh told me, "you're too big for that." So my goal is to hit the [1000 pound club](http://movethebar.org/programs/1000-pound-club/) by the end of my next bulk in April 2017.

### Power Hypertrophy Adaptive Training

This training routine, referred to as [PHAT](http://www.simplyshredded.com/mega-feature-layne-norton-training-series-full-powerhypertrophy-routine-updated-2011.html), was created by [Layne Norton](https://www.biolayne.com/) to combine the powerlifting and bodybuilding styles of training. The program trains each body part twice a week, increasing growth potential. PHAT is divided up into two types of training days: power and hypertrophy. I am using the following weekly split, with Saturday and Sunday off.

| Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday |
|:------:|:-------:|:---------:|:--------:|:------:|
| Upper Body Power | Lower Body Power | Back & Shoulders Hypertrophy | Lower Body Hypertrophy | Chest & Arms Hypertrophy |
{: class="table table-bordered table-condensed" }

The power days contain two main movements, supplemented with auxiliary movements. I plan to switch out these power movements every three weeks. Hypertrophy days take the same two power movements, but focus on speed with lighter weight. Then additional exercises are performed in a higher rep range.

Layne Norton suggests an example split, which I modified slightly to fit my needs. Below is the exact routine that I will be following for the first three week period of PHAT.

* __Monday: Upper Body Power__
  * Barbell Rows (3 sets x 3-5 reps)
  * Weighted Pull Ups (2 sets x 6-10 reps)
  * Lat Pulldown (2 sets x 6-10 reps)

  * Weighted Tricep Dips (2 sets x 6-10 reps)
  * Seated Dumbbell Press (3 sets x 6-10 reps)
  * Barbell Curls (3 sets x 6-10 reps)
  * Skullcrushers (3 sets x 6-10 reps)

* __Tuesday: Lower Body Power__
  * Squats (3 sets x 3-5 reps)
  * Hack Squats (2 sets x 6-10 reps)
  * Leg Extensions (2 sets x 6-10 reps)
  * Stiff Legged Deadlifts (3 sets x 5-8 reps)
  * Lying Leg Curls (2 sets x 6-10 reps)
  * Standing Calf Raises (3 sets x 6-10 reps)
  * Seated Calf Raises (2 sets x 6-10 reps)

* __Wednesday: Back & Shoulders Hypertrophy__
  * Barbell Rows (6 sets x 3 reps)
  * Lat Pulldown (3 sets x 8-12 reps)
  * Cable Rows (3 sets x 8-12 reps)
  * Dumbbell Rows (2 sets x 12-15 reps)
  * V-Bar Pulldown (2 sets x 15-20 reps)
  * Dumbbell Press (3 sets x 8-12 reps)
  * Upright Rows (2 sets x 12-15 reps)
  * Lat Raises (3 sets x 12-20 reps)

* __Thursday: Lower Body Hypertrophy__
  * Squats (6 sets x 3 reps)
  * Hack Squats (3 sets x 8-12 reps)
  * Leg Press (2 sets x 12-15 reps)
  * Leg Extensions (3 sets x 15-20 reps)
  * Romanian Deadlifts (3 sets x 8-12 reps)
  * Lying Leg Curls (2 sets x 12-15 reps)
  * Seated Leg Curls (2 sets x 15-20 reps)
  * Standing Calf Raises (4 sets x 10-15 reps)
  * Seated Calf Raises (3 sets x 15-20 reps)

* __Friday: Chest & Arms Hypertrophy__
  * Dumbbell Press (6 sets x 3 reps)
  * Incline Dumbbell Press (3 sets x 8-12 reps)
  * Hammer Strength Chest Press (3 sets x 12-15 reps)
  * Incline Cable Fly (2 sets x 15-20 reps)
  * Preacher Curls (3 sets x 8-12 reps)
  * Concentration Curls (2 sets x 12-15 reps)
  * Spider Curls (2 sets x 15-20 reps)
  * Seated EZ Bar Tricep Extensions (3 sets x 8-12 reps)
  * Rope Pulldown (2 sets x 12-15 reps)
  * Cable Kickbacks (2 sets x 15-20 reps)

I plan to switch out some of the power exercises every three weeks to give variety. I'll switch dumbbell press for bench press and barbell rows for deadlifts in order to practice the big three lifts and get me closer to the 1000 pound club.

There is full write up on the program by Layne Norton at the [Simply Shredded](http://www.simplyshredded.com/mega-feature-layne-norton-training-series-full-powerhypertrophy-routine-updated-2011.html) website which goes over the program in more detail. It talks about the theory behind the program, rest periods, speed reps, going to failure, and plateauing. I highly suggest reading the whole article before beginning this program!

Let me know if you've tried out PHAT before and what your results were!
