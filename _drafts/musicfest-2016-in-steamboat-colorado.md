*I thought getting to MusicFest was a pipe dream.* That is until Gaby and I took a beach trip to Corpus Christi in 2015, battled E. Coli, and weaseled our way into the best vacation we've ever had.

### Cornhole Was Key

It was hard to forget that beach trip. We just got into town, dropped our stuff at the hotel, and headed for a drink at the closest beach bar. But just before we could get our first whiskey and coke, we heard the news that the Corpus water supply had been infected with E. Coli. Luckily the city was having ice shipped in from out of town, so we picked up a few bags and hit the beach.

We set up our cornhole boards, poured a drink and started playing. Shortly after we got going, two guys stopped and struck up a conversation about the boards. We found that they liked country music and had a lot in common with us, so we all made a plan to meet up the next day at the beach. By the end of the weekend, Grant had let us know that he had extra spots for MusicFest, and we jumped on it immediately. A few weeks later Grant officially gave us the thumbs up to send him our deposit and we were in!

### Getting There
Just getting to Steamboat was a battle, and looking back on our trip there I would have changed a few things. We took an early flight (*woke up at 3AM!*) to Denver, and then a charter bus run by [Bear Creek Tours](http://bearcreektoursllc.com/) for the long drive to Steamboat. While having essentially unlimited alcohol and country music on a charter bus for a three hour ride sounds amazing, it kind of turned into a shit show.

You see, the group we rode out with turned out to be quite a few young'uns. Instead of playing Texas country music, they wanted to listen to rap music. Instead of having some beers on the way, they wanted to get wasted and yell for the whole ride. Now this wouldn't be that bad if the trip took three hours like it was supposed to, but between picking up additional passengers in downtown Denver, stopping to fix the bus speakers, and a cautious elderly driver, the trip turned into a six hour ordeal.

On the plus side, the manager Jace was great. He was well organized, on time, and very easy going. Next time though, I think a rental car is the way to go.

### Steamboat Resort
Pulling into Steamboat was a dream after that bus ride, and it was worth every minute. The resort was gorgeous with the backdrop of the mountains. At first it seemed big, but we quickly learned our way around. The base of the mountain opens up to a center square, with the ski shops and a few restaurants around it. In the middle of the square there's an outdoor stage, and just across from it sits a patio bar, which was a great place to catch a show and watch people come down the mountain.

Our condo was insane. Originally meant for ten people, we only had four from our group show up, so we got it all to ourselves! The place was decorated very outdoorsy, with lots of wooden furniture, a fireplace, and a great patio that overlooked the resort.

What amazed me most though, is how many artists we ran into just walking around. Josh Grider, William Clark Green, Cody Johnson, Roger Creager, Wade Bowen, Turnpike Troubadors, and Corey Morrow all said hey to us as we walked right by them. We even snagged a picture with Cody! You could tell everyone was relaxed, as if they were on a vacation just like us.
